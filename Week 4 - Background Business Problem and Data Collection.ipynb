    "It accounts for the most business activity, hosts the main financial market, and is the leading destination on education, gastronomy, cultural activity and entertainment, because of its great cultural diversity coming from different regions of the country, and so, its also responsible for 56% of the tourism that arrives to Colombia.\n",

    "\n",
    "I have considered that an ideal location should be nearby nightlife zones, since party environments favor beer consumption, next to other beer pubs, since competition favors the attention and asures traffic of focused or niche groups (home brewed beer consumers) or near universities, since culturaly younger adults use to spend their leisure time drinking beer while waiting for classtime or after finishing the study journey (although budget can be a constraint in that niche).  \n"
